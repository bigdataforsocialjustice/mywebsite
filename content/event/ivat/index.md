summary: "This study advocates for an informed public health framework to reduce and prevent firearm injury, including death, while promoting the well-being of vulnerable populations.  Public health policies do not always incorporate violence as a possible outcome or unintended consequence. The Safe Routes to School 'SRTS’ program is exemplary. I demonstrate that 'SRTS’ may need to be preempted by programs that consider the potential impact of gun violence exposure in vulnerable neighborhoods. Specifically, the SRTS program may achieve its goals better in neighborhoods where walking does not increase the risk of gun violence exposure. The framework is informed by innovative data and analyses which are critical to illustrate how public health policies, such as SRTS, obscure spatial inequities in youth activity spaces, including schools."
