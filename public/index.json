There are websites that offer ways to incorporate ArcGIS pro, R and Python but the forget some of the details needed to make everything work, which can be frustrating for a new user. So, here is one solution to quickly geocode thousands of records using the integration package.\nThe accessibility of this method is limited, you must have access to arcgis online. Thankfully I have an account through my university. Assuming that you have an account, you must tell ArcGIS Pro where your version of R is located and install the arcgisbinding package via the Options menu item in your ArcGIS Pro software (as shown below).

In the mid-1800s public and private agencies were routinely removing minor tribal citizens (hereafter “MTCs”) from their homes with the Federal Government’s consent. About 100 years later, a Congressional investigation revealed that between 25–35% of MTCs in the US were taken from families by state welfare agencies. The result was a gross disproportionality in the number of MTCs being removed from their homes and placed into foster care. More specifically, MTCs were 7–8 times more likely to be removed compared to white children with the vast majority placed in non — Tribal homes with white parents.\nThe overrepresentation of Native American children in our child welfare system has been attributed to the multiple systems of oppression that work in conjunction to harm communities of color. These systems are ignorant of tribal customs and refuse to acknowledge the benefits of prevailing cultural and social norms that characterize indigenous communities. In an acknowledgment of these facts and in response to the wholesale removal of children from indigenous households, in 1978 the US government enacted the “Indian Child Welfare Act” (ICWA). The ICWA (25 U.S.C. §1902) which was enacted by congress in accordance with its authority under the “Indian” commerce clause, has been described as a “monumental piece of legislation” that affects every Native American child born in the united states (Fletcher, 2007). Nevertheless, Native American children continue to be over-involved in the child welfare system at rates that are incongruent with their share of the population. In South Dakota, for example, available data from 2014–2018 show that Native American children remain disproportionately overrepresented in the child welfare system compared to other groups (see figure below). Importantly, 9 in 10 children are substantiated for neglect, which is defined as a parent or caregiver’s inability to meet a child’s basic needs. As I have previously noted elsewhere, child neglect and poverty are a tautology in this country.\nChile welfare involvement by Race/Ethnicity in South Dakota One critical element that is missing to shed light on the plight of indigenous communities is data. With the advent and availability of large, innovative datasets, however, it is now fairly easy to analyze ICWA caselaw in a systematic way — to better understand the issues and evaluate change over time. Therefore, as a first step in better understanding the circumstances surrounding family separation, we began to analyze ICWA caselaw using a broad social and ecological framework. One question we had was why, despite the enactment of the ICWA, have Native American children continued to be disproportionately represented in the foster care system decades after its enactment. The goal was to advocate for the creation of more sensitive and effective interventions that minimize involvement of indigenous families in the child welfare system.\nOur Analysis Here, we describe the first step of our analysis, namely to identify and download a corpus of ICWA caselaw for further analysis. Thereafter, we are able to analyze the caselaw text (i.e. the corpus) using more advanced textual analysis and data science tools.\nLegal documents are very complicated. Luckily, the Harvard Law School provides a way to access caselaw data fairly easily. The data for this analysis comes from Harvard Law School’s Caselaw Access Project (“CAP”) which can be accessed here https://case.law. As discussed on their website, the purpose of the CAP is to expand public access to U.S. law by providing a searchable database and an Application Programming Interface (”API”). The goal of this project is to make all published U.S. court decisions freely available to the public online, in a consistent format, digitized from the collection of the Harvard Law Library. According to their website, at the time of this writing, the CAP makes 6,725,065 unique cases available from 625 Reporters and they have 35,666,018 pages scanned. To learn more about Harvard’s CAP click here. The Harvard Law School also made a short video announcing the Caselaw Access Project at case.law which you can view below.\nAnnouncing the Caselaw Access Project: Source: Harvard Law School The first step is to access all ICWA caselaw data available through the CAP API. The data includes an ID, case name, decision date, docket number, parties, jurisdiction, cases cited and full text, among other things. The graphic below is a snapshot of the results from the link above. The Case Document List pictured below shows us that there are 899 cases returned from our search of the term “ICWA” that are available to download.\nWe accessed the caselaw data, stored the resulting data into a json object and then converted the results to a data set in R with the following code:\nbase_url = …","date":1620777600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620777600,"objectID":"279b9966ca9cf3121ce924dca452bb1c","permalink":"https://giabarboza\u003e.github.io/post/getting-started/","publishdate":"2021-05-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/getting-started/","section":"post","summary":"Textual analysis of case law can help identify areas to improve child welfare","tags":["BigData4SocialJustice"],"title":"Mining the “Indian Child Welfare Act” (ICWA) using Harvard Law School’s Caselaw API","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Predatory lending and foreclosures exacerbated the racial gap in homeownership and led to historic wealth loss; past research lacked the key predatory characteristic and thus underestimates harm. With advances in data science, availability of big data, and appropriate statistical and geo-spatial models, the project will quantify the unequal wealth loss from predatory lending and estimate causal impact. The dataset integrates HMDA, assessor, census, and HUD data, ZTRAX property and voting records. We address: (1) the evolution of predatory lending mortgage originations over time and across geographic areas; (2) If loans originations had kept their pre-housing bubble and foreclosure crisis trend, what would wealth distribution be in areas hardest hit? The causal inference uses Bayesian structural time series modeling to predict the counterfactual wealth gap had predatory lending not occurred. An Emergent Hot Spot Analysis will identify hot and cold spots to predict spatiotemporal trends.\nBackground and Research Question By the early 2000s the United States (US) saw the highest percentages of homeownership in history (Kochhar, Fry, and Taylor 2011). But by 2017, the percentage of property owned by Black and Indigenous People of Color (BIPOC) in the US was less than it was 100 years earlier (Agyeman and Boone 2020) and any early 2000s homeownership gains made by BIPOC had been reversed. This wealth reduction was concurrent with the largest real estate bubble in US history, characterized by inflationary price increases on homes that incentivized rapid-fire origination of “high cost” mortgages that were overpriced relative to the value of the home (Goldstein 2014). But what was the role of predatory lending and the longest and by far the worst foreclosure crisis since before the American Revolution in increasing economic inequality today?\nThe housing bubble, starting in 2002, followed by the 2008 market crash and then the foreclosure crisis of 2010, resulted in significant economic loss to individuals and neighborhoods. According to Kochhar, Fry, and Taylor (2011), between 2005 and 2009, the median household wealth for Black, Latino and Asian households in the United States dropped by 53%, 66% and 34%, respectively, while the median wealth of white households dropped by merely 16%. As the study explained: “developments in the housing market are the principal agents of change in household wealth from 2005 to 2009” (Kochhar, Fry , and Taylor 2011 p.17) that are largely attributable to predatory lending originations and disproportionately impacted working class communities of color, BIPOC and women heads of household borrowers. Evidence suggests these practices continue to exert a negative effect on these communities today. For example, a 2019 study conducted by the Urban Institute found that the 30% gap between black and white home ownership is greater now than before 1968, when housing discrimination was legal (Young 2019).\nEvidence suggests that the home ownership gap and, therefore, wealth divide, between white households and households of color has been exacerbated by predatory lending through ongoing wealth stripping of inflated monthly billing as well as high foreclosure rates. For example, among home purchase loans made in 2006, roughly one out of every two loans made to African American (50%) and Latino (46%) borrowers were high cost, compared to fewer than one out of five loans made to white borrowers (18%) (Ben, Ellen, and Madar 2019). According to Squires (2005), the systematic channeling of otherwise qualified minority borrowers into subprime mortgages carrying high costs and risks was one form of reverse redlining. At the 2006 peak of the subprime market, 27% of all loan originations were subprime, including 49% and 39% of loans to African-Americans and Latinos, respectively (Bocian, Li, Reid, and Quercia 2011).\nOverinflated loan-to-value ratios are the single most important factor leading to default and/or foreclosure (Quercia and Stegman 1992). Research has shown that even when loan to value ratios are raised from 90% to 97%, default rates for new homes increase seven-fold. Whereas the foreclosure crisis coincided with sharp decreases in household wealth, with and without home equity, for all families, regardless of race or ethnicity, research has shown that by 2011 wealth levels for whites began to show signs of recovery. The typical Black family, on the other hand, continued to experience severe declines, losing an estimated 40% of non-home-equity wealth throughout this time frame (Burd-Sharps \u0026amp; Rasch, 2015). The amount of wealth lost was and still is directly attributable to the magnitude and timing of the housing bubble in different communities: that is, predatory lending began earlier, lasted longer, and was more aggressive resulting in proportionately greater loss of wealth.\nBut, what would the wealth gap be had the type of lending, bubble and foreclosures never happened?

The documentary is a six-part miniseries about the 2013 murder of Gabriel Fernandez, an 8-year old Palmdale boy, that aired on Netflix February, 2020. In 2013, Gabriel Fernandez died in the neighborhood of LA county called Palmdale. For years, Gabriel was abused by his mother and her boyfriend. The abuse included being beaten, shot with a BB gun, smothered with pepper spray, made to wear girl’s clothes to school, forced to eat his own vomit, and locked in a cabinet with a sock stuffed in his mouth. His biological father was incarcerated previously. From 2003 – 2012 over 60 complaints were filed leading to 8 investigations by Child Protective Services. His mother and her boyfriend were given life sentences for his death. The social workers were charged with felony child abuse and falsifying public documents.\nThe case of Gabriel Fernandez demonstrates the complexity of the risk factors and the profound psychological impact that fatal child maltreatment has on members of the community. It also highlights aspects of our social, legal and criminal justice systems that are in desperate need of reform. Gabriel’s teacher, family and even the prosecutor discussed the psychological toll it took on them. Apparently, their pleas for help from Child Protective Services were of no avail.\nWhat first piqued my interest about this case is that it happened again, about 5 years later, when 4-year old Anthony Alvalos was murdered 15 minutes from Garbiel’s home. The cases were almost identical, even regarding the fact that Anthony’s parents thought he, too, was gay.\nMy Work As a researcher of child abuse and neglect, I have known about the Gabriel Fernandez case for years. My own work explores the structural aspects of child welfare across time and space. If I could boil this work down to one central message it would be that neighborhood characteristics, in addition to the characteristics of children and families, are critical components of child maltreatment prevention. Nevertheless, the characteristics of neighborhoods are often overlooked in preventive interventions. The characteristics of neighborhoods are important to understand for many reasons. One of the most important reasons is because they reflect the structural components of race and class and how they play themselves out in the area of child abuse.\nThe Problem One difficulty that I have encountered in my research is the lack of data on child abuse and neglect, particularly that which pertains to child homicides. This has forced me to think outside the box about data and data collection efforts. As a methodologist, as well, I understand full well that innovative methods of machine learning are going to be an important component of applied research. Whereas it is relatively easy to give answers to well-structured questions, when there is no structure to the data standard statistical analyses are inapplicable. Unstructured data makes up 80-90% of all data produced by organizations (Holzinger, Stocker et al., 2013) including police reports, court documents and human service organizations. In order to understand patterns in such data, machine learning algorithms such as text mining and topic modeling can help given meaning to narrative, unstructured text. Therefore, understanding the power of data science, including web scraping and text mining, is a critical part of developing a holistic approach to child protection. In this first article, I will illustrate how I created a dataset of all child homicides in Los Angeles County by scraping the Los Angeles Times Homicide report located here\nThe first step (see figure 1) in this project was to collect geospatial data on child homicides.\nFigure 1.

Participants were children under 18 years old reported to the Los Angeles Police Department for CAN. Negative binomial regression was used to explore associations between the implementation of social distancing protocols and reported CAN during COVID-19. Spatiotemporal analysis identified locations of emerging hot and cold spots during the pandemic. Associations between neighborhood structural factors (e.g., school absenteeism, poverty, unemployment, housing insecurity and birth assets) and hot and cold spot patterns were explored. There was a statistically significant decline in reports of CAN during the COVID-19 pandemic but no significant trends following the implementation of social distancing measures (e.g. safer at home orders, school closures). Compared to consecutive cold spots, severe housing burden, the number of assets children have at birth, poverty, school absenteeism and labor force participation were significantly associated with new and intensifying hotspots of CAN during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings reinforce the utility of developing intervention strategies that minimize harm to children by targeting resources to specific challenges facing families enduring the COVID-19 experience.","tags":null,"title":"A spatiotemporal analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on child abuse and neglect in the city of Los Angeles, California","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gia Elise Barboza","Lawrence Schiamberg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"870cafa507b72b149ce29ee29b9481be","permalink":"https://giabarboza\u003e.github.io/publication/2021-01-01_dual_trajectories_of/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-01-01_dual_trajectories_of/","section":"publication","summary":"Postpartum depression and low parental self-efficacy (PSE) are risk factors for poor child behavior.

A full understanding of the dynamics of cyberbullying and the development of effective interventions requires an appreciation of the contributions of the multiple contexts, or the ecology of cyberbullying, including the family, peer group, school, and neighborhood/community (Barboza et al., 2009; Espelage \u0026 Swearer, 2009). Given that school experiences and peer relationships therein are central in the lives of adolescents, considerable attention has been directed at the school and peer context of cyberbullying (Barboza, 2015). Much less research attention, however, has been directed toward understanding racial and ethnic diversity and its relationship to cyberbullying and other online risk behaviors, in the school context.","tags":null,"title":"Racial and Ethnic Diversity in the Social Ecology of Online Harassment and Cybervictimization: The Adolescent\textendash School Context","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Brandon C.

However, in many settings of interest, agent utility functions themselves vary as a result of past agent choices. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to formulate and analyze such models which feature game-environment feedback. For instance, a highly prevalent virus may incentivize individuals to wear masks, but extensive adoption of mask-wearing reduces virus prevalence which in turn reduces individual incentives for mask-wearing. What is the interplay between epidemic severity and the behaviors of a victim population? For initial answers, we develop a general framework using probabilistic coupling methods that can be used to derive the stochastically stable states of log-linear learning in certain games which feature such game-environment feedback. We then apply this framework to a simple dynamic game-theoretic model of social precautions in an epidemic and give conditions under which maximallycautious social behavior in this model is stochastically stable.","tags":["Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory","Computer Science - Multiagent Systems"],"title":"Robust Stochastic Stability in Dynamic and Reactive Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lori Ann Post","Brian Biroscak","Gia Elise Barboza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"fbf1adb82db7e6bb0de29b41aa519c3e","permalink":"https://giabarboza\u003e.github.io/publication/sex_violence_prev/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sex_violence_prev/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Sexual Violence Prevalence","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gia Elise Barboza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"c6113eba5158fdc540759e4354164860","permalink":"https://giabarboza\u003e.github.io/publication/adol_context_bully/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/adol_context_bully/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"The adolescent parent context and positive youth development in the ecology of cyberbullying.

It affects millions each year and costs billions of dollars annually. Prevention and intervention of elder maltreatment requires a holistic approach that is interdisciplinary and incorporates a variety of diverse theoretical perspectives that fundamentally change how systems of elder care interact and operate. This chapter synthesizes the current knowledge on elder abuse and neglect. It begins by discussing some methodological limitations associated with defining and conceptualizing elder maltreatment along with its consequence for understanding the scope of the problem. It then discusses the individual-level risk and protective factors for elder abuse and neglect across a variety of institutional settings. Next, the risk and protective factors are situated in the context of sociological and criminological theories and a policy framework for elder abuse prevention and intervention based on current evidence-based practices is articulated. The chapter ends by discussing emergent directions that researchers, practitioners and stakeholders must address in order to ensure that our nation's most vulnerable population is free from victimization in variegated settings.","tags":null,"title":"The Theory and Practice of Elder-Abuse Prevention","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gia Elise Barboza","Kate Angulski"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"c1c8fcf12d82056c1f02afafba909a87","permalink":"https://giabarboza\u003e.github.io/publication/2020-01-01_a_descriptive_study_/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-01-01_a_descriptive_study_/","section":"publication","summary":"Introduction: Drug overdose is a significant public health problem, yet little is known about racial/ethnic differences in drug overdose rates and/or in responses to a drug overdose following naloxone administration. This paper examines differences in rates of survivorship, response, revival and administration of naloxone by race and ethnicity among those who experienced a drug overdose in Pennsylvania between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2019. Spatio-temporal variations in drug overdose locations were examined to facilitate understanding of service development, planning, and delivery of effective treatment need. Methods: Ten thousand two hundred and ninety drug overdose incidents were analyzed from the Pennsylvania Overdose Information Network (ODIN). The ODIN is a centralized repository that contains information on drug overdoses victims including age, gender and race/ethnicity, naloxone administrations and survivorship, drug(s) suspected of causing the overdose, victim outcomes (e.g. hospitalizations and arrests) and average naloxone dosage per victim. Between group differences were tested using {$chi$}2 -tests of independence. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the predicted probability of survivorship according to victim characteristics. All statistical analyses and mapping were performed using the R statistical programming environment. Results: About eighty-seven percent of drug overdose response victims were white, and seventy-one percent were between the ages of 20textendash 39. White females were more likely to receive an overdose response compared to black or Hispanic females. A non-opioid was indicated more frequently in overdoses involving black victims compared to either whites or Latinos. Latinos and blacks were more likely to survive a drug overdose. However, following naloxone administration, no racial or ethnic differences in survivorship were noted. Differences in responsiveness to naloxone and transitions to care following the drug overdose event were also found. Finally, overdoses among Blacks and Latinos demonstrated a stronger spatial patterning across counties compared to whites. Conclusions: This study found a significant, disparate impact of race/ethnicity on fatal drug overdoses when naloxone is not administered. Further, individuals who were administered naloxone and subsequently received medical care in a hospital experienced lower drug-related mortality, suggesting that first responders are critical intervention points for individuals in need of medical treatment following a drug overdose. However, while naloxone administration is a necessary first step in the recovery process, longitudinal pathways towards treatment are critical to stem the drug overdose crisis.","tags":null,"title":"A Descriptive Study of Racial and Ethnic Differences of Drug Overdoses and Naloxone Administration in Pennsylvania","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gia Elise Barboza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"1586e8370245c4e1df18a7d844bb214a","permalink":"https://giabarboza\u003e.github.io/publication/2020-01-01_a_spatiotemporal_a/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-01-01_a_spatiotemporal_a/","section":"publication","summary":"Using a combination of data derived from the U.S. Census Bureau, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration's Behavioral Health Systems Locator and the Boston Police Department's Incident Reports, this study examines the spatiotemporal distribution of calls for medical assistance following a heroin-related injury between 2015 and 2018. As well, an examination is conducted regarding the accessibility of Health Care Centers (HCCs) in relation to individuals in need of medical assistance. Distance-based measures of spatial association, including nearest neighbor and K-function analysis, were used to determine the clustering of calls at various spatial scales. Structural neighborhood characteristics (i.e., distance to the closest HCC) and physical and social vulnerability were used to predict the rate of calls for a heroinrelated injury per 1,000 persons in the city of Boston using a spatial autoregressive model. HCC catchment areas for the set of medical emergency calls were created using Voronoi tessellations. Results showed that the average nearest neighbor distance (NND) of each call for medical assistance was approximately 187 m or .12 miles. Calls for assistance became more probable and increasingly more spatially concentrated over the study period. The K-function analysis revealed that the calls clustered at different spatial scales and in proximity to HCCs. Average distance to the nearest HCC and Household/Disability vulnerability were significantly associated with the census tract call rate per 1,000 persons. The average travel distance between the calls for medical assistance and the nearest HCC was 941 m, or just over a half-mile. Policy implications for the provision, through HCCs, of a focused and comprehensive community-based support system in a large urban city for individuals with serious drug problems are discussed in context.","tags":null,"title":"A Spatiotemporal Analysis of Heroin-Related Calls for Emergency Medical Services and Community-Health Centers in Boston, Massachusetts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gia Barboza","Joan Goldsworthy Appel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"055c04a201a7e5fe59dd6ce49a4304f3","permalink":"https://giabarboza\u003e.github.io/publication/2020-01-01_child_maltreatment_d/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-01-01_child_maltreatment_d/","section":"publication","summary":"(Abstract not available)","tags":null,"title":"Child Maltreatment Data in the State of New Mexico across Space and Time","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gia Elise Barboza-Salerno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"3ed465b9c809d85dc3d27767e58d7d27","permalink":"https://giabarboza\u003e.github.io/publication/2020-01-01_cognitive_readiness_/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-01-01_cognitive_readiness_/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Cognitive Readiness to Parent, Stability and Change in Postpartum Parenting Stress and Social-Emotional Problems in Early Childhood: A Second Order Growth Curve Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gia Elise Barboza-Salerno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"0a08f590c31b72df7c9e440ae45bb928","permalink":"https://giabarboza\u003e.github.io/publication/2020-01-01_examining_spatial_/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-01-01_examining_spatial_/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Examining Spatial Regimes of Child Maltreatment Allegations in a Social Vulnerability Framework","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gia Elise Barboza-Salerno"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"9431752ea070ac8100d4b654ec96b414","permalink":"https://giabarboza\u003e.github.io/publication/2020-01-01_variability_and_stab/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-01-01_variability_and_stab/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Variability and Stability in Child Maltreatment Risk across Time and Space and Its Association with Neighborhood Social \u0026 Housing Vulnerability in New Mexico: A Bayesian Space-Time Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;\rif porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;:\rprint(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)\rMath In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}\rPress Space to play!\nOne **Two** Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}}\r- Only the speaker can read these notes\r- Press `S` key to view\r{{% /speaker_note %}}\rPress the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt;

The current study examined latent class trajectories of depressive symptoms using data from 3,819 respondents of the Adolescent Health Survey. Four trajectory profiles of depressive symptoms were identified: low-stable, high-decreasing, low-increasing, and moderate-decreasing. A broad array of risk factors were included into the modeling procedure to identify predictors of group membership. Relative to the low-stable group, membership in one of the three symptomatic groups (i.e., heightened depressive symptoms) was predicted by poverty, low self-esteem, gender, drinking frequency, poor academic outcomes, delinquency, and child maltreatment type. This study contributes to our understanding about the longitudinal manifestations of depression and identifies a broad array of factors significantly related to pathways of resilience.","tags":null,"title":"Child Maltreatment, Delinquent Behavior, and School Factors as Predictors of Depressive Symptoms from Adolescence to Adulthood: A Growth Mixture Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gia E.

Child maltreatment data on 83,379 child maltreatment cases in 1,678 census tracts spanning 2006-2009 were obtained from the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services. Substantiated referral counts were analyzed across census tracts with Bayesian hierarchical spatial models using integrated nested Laplace approximations. Results showed that the unadjusted yearly rate of child abuse and neglect held fairly steady over the study period decreasing by only 2.57%. However, the temporal term in the spatiotemporal model reflected a downward trend beginning in 2007. High rates of abuse and neglect were predicted by several neighborhood-level measures of structural burden. Every 1-unit decrease in the social vulnerability index reduced the  risk of child abuse and neglect by 98.3% (95% CrI = 1.869-2.1042) while every 1-unit increase in the Black–White dissimilarity index decreased child abuse and neglect risk by 70.6%. The interaction of these variables  demonstrated the protective effect of racial heterogeneity in socially vulnerable neighborhoods. No such effect was found in neighborhoods characterized by low levels of vulnerability. Population-based child abuse and neglect prevention and intervention efforts should be aided by the  characteristics of neighborhoods that demonstrate strong spatial patterns even after accounting for the role of race and place.","tags":null,"title":"The Geography of Child Maltreatment: A Spatiotemporal Analysis Using Bayesian Hierarchical Analysis With Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gia Barboza"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"ba4267f4e1f3210e047852fe5818ac23","permalink":"https://giabarboza\u003e.github.io/publication/2018-01-01_a_secondary_spatia/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-01-01_a_secondary_spatia/","section":"publication","summary":"(Abstract not available)","tags":null,"title":"A Secondary Spatial Analysis of Gun Violence near Boston Schools: A Public Health Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Brian J.

Most of the literature examining the relationship between child physical abuse (CPA) and adult violence has focused narrowly on academic outcomes rather than taking a broader view that explores the processes undergirding school engagement and connections. The present study adopted Connell's model of school engagement, connectedness and outcomes within a social bond framework to examine (a) the link between CPA and school social bonds, (b) the link between CPA and adult violence persistence, and (c) the mediational (parallel, serial) effects of school bonds (engagement, connection, and achievement) on violence perpetration in adulthood. Consistent with previous research, results indicated that children who experience physical abuse have poorer academic performance, which, in turn, is related to future violent trajectories. We further found that the relationship between CPA and violence persistence is mediated by a process of bonding to school that begins with being actively engaged in school activities and ends with higher levels of academic achievement. In particular, some of the ``school achievement'' effect found in previous research operates through behavioral and emotional manifestations and may be partly explained through physically abused children's lessened ability to be engaged with and connected to school activities. We conclude with a discussion of the policy implications stemming from our findings.","tags":null,"title":"Child Maltreatment, School Bonds, and Adult Violence: A Serial Mediation Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gia Barboza","Silvia Dominguez","Laura Siller","Miguel Montalva"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"37ad177c0996d28c09fc653810cec689","permalink":"https://giabarboza\u003e.github.io/publication/2017-01-01_citizenship_fear_an/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-01-01_citizenship_fear_an/","section":"publication","summary":"Purpose textendash{} The purpose of this paper is to explore the association between Mexicans' support for the criminalization of immigration and level of police contact, fear of deportation and the perceived personal impact of immigration enforcement.","tags":null,"title":"Citizenship, Fear and Support for the Criminalization of Immigration: Contextualizing Mexican Americans' Attitudes about the Role of Law Enforcement","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gia Elise Barboza","Silvia Dominguez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"36b9f0bd012596d97217c3bb28a472b9","permalink":"https://giabarboza\u003e.github.io/publication/2017-01-01_longitudinal_growth_/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-01-01_longitudinal_growth_/","section":"publication","summary":"Few longitudinal studies have analyzed how traumatic experiences (e.g. home removal, violence exposure) influence both depressive and Post-Traumatic Stress (PTS) symptoms in children involved with Child Protective Services (CPS). This study investigated the change trajectories of both depressive and PTS symptomatology as well as their associations over time, focusing on the effect of complex trauma. Data were obtained from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (1999textendash 2007), a nationally representative study of children and adolescents who were referred to child protective services for alleged maltreatment. The Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) scale measured depressive symptoms and the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder section of a version of the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC) provided the measure of current traumarelated symptoms or distress. Analyses were conducted using a parallel process growth curve model. The participants' initial levels of depressive and PTS symptomatology were significantly and positively related; furthermore, any changes in these two outcomes were also correlated longitudinally. The initial assessment of PTS symptoms significantly contributed to the advancement of more severe depressive symptoms over time. No significant differences were found between youth who remained in the home and those removed from the home. However, violence exposure, sexual abuse, gender and age were significant predictors of level and rate of change in both PTS and depressive symptoms. PTS growth factors mediated the longitudinal relationship between witnessing severe violence and depressive symptoms. The findings suggest a complex developmental association between depressive and PTS symptomatology among CPS-involved youth that is rooted in early childhood experiences with complex trauma.","tags":null,"title":"Longitudinal Growth of Post-Traumatic Stress and Depressive Symptoms Following a Child Maltreatment Allegation: An Examination of Violence Exposure, Family Risk and Placement Type","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gia Elise Barboza","Silvia Dominguez","Jyda Pinder"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"eecbac673d0ba70a4ab49afd62008778","permalink":"https://giabarboza\u003e.github.io/publication/2017-01-01_trajectories_of_post/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-01-01_trajectories_of_post/","section":"publication","summary":"Few longitudinal studies have analyzed how violence exposure (e.g. child maltreatment, witnessing community violence) influence both externalizing and Post-Traumatic Stress (PTS) symptoms among children in foster care. Data from three waves of the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (1999textendash 2007) (NSCAW; National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect, 2002) were analyzed to investigate the change trajectories of both externalizing and PTS symptomatology among children with a substantiated report of child maltreatment by Child Protective Services (CPS) between October 1999 and December 2000. This study uses data collected at three time points: baseline and approximately 18 (Wave 3) and 36 (Wave 4) months post-baseline. The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) scale measured externalizing symptoms and the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder section of a version of the Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC) provided the measure of current trauma-related symptoms or distress. Analyses were conducted using a parallel process growth curve model with a sample of n = 280 maltreated youth between the ages of 8 and 15 following home removal. Findings revealed that initial levels of externalizing and PTS symptomatology were both significantly and positively related and co-develop over time. Externalizing symptom severity remained in the borderline range during the first two years in out-of-home care. Both direct and indirect forms of interpersonal violence exposure were associated with initial level of externalizing symptom and PTS symptom severity, respectively. Taken together, our results suggest an underlying process that links early violence exposure to the co-development and cumulative impact of PTS on externalizing behavior above and beyond experiences of maltreatment. We conclude by discussing the key points of intervention that result from a more nuanced understanding of the longitudinal relationship between PTS and externalizing symptoms and the effect of complex trauma on growth in these symptoms over time.","tags":null,"title":"Trajectories of Post-Traumatic Stress and Externalizing Psychopathology among Maltreated Foster Care Youth: A Parallel Process Latent Growth Curve Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gia Elise Barboza","Silvia Dominguez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"ee44668dbad9a16db149b7f2f2a4c0e6","permalink":"https://giabarboza\u003e.github.io/publication/2016-01-01_a_sequential_logit_m/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016-01-01_a_sequential_logit_m/","section":"publication","summary":"Objectives. This study explores the predisposing, enabling, and need-based factors associated with parents' or guardians' decision to have their child initiate, continue, and complete the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. Methods. Parents and guardians of children between the ages of 9 and 17 years who completed the 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey collected by the Center for Disease Control (CDC, 2010) were analyzed. Utilizing Andersen's health care beliefs model, we explored the sequential nature of the decision to vaccinate (i.e., the decision to receive the first, second, and third dose), thereby allowing the independent variables to vary across each transition. Results. Among all children, 3.7% received exactly 1 shot, 16.3% received at least one shot, and 8.9% received all three shots. Among those who received at least one shot, 22.4% received exactly one shot, 23.7% received exactly 2 shots, and 54.9% completed all 3 shots. A differential impact was observed across transitions. Predisposing factors, such as being Hispanic (OR = 1.9) and child age (OR = 1.4), significantly predicted the decision to receive the first dose but enabling factors, such as having a regular physician (OR = 4.5) and income (OR = .74) were more important for predicting completion. Conclusions. The decision to initiate and complete HPV vaccination depends on a specific mix of enabling, predisposing, and need-based factors. Our analysis underscores the importance of modeling the vaccination decision in a manner that is consistent with how primary caregivers navigate real-life health care decisions for their children.","tags":null,"title":"A Sequential Logit Model of Caretakers' Decision to Vaccinate Children for the Human Papillomavirus Virus in the General Population","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gia Elise Barboza","Silvia Dominguez","Elena Chace"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"b29c84aeea861c239ead85e9252ce596","permalink":"https://giabarboza\u003e.github.io/publication/2016-01-01_physical_victimizati/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016-01-01_physical_victimizati/","section":"publication","summary":"We investigated whether being attacked physically due to one's gender identity or expression was associated with suicide risk among trans men and women living in Virginia. The sample consisted of 350 transgender men and women who participated in the Virginia Transgender Health Initiative Survey (THIS). Multivariate multinomial logistic regression was used to explore the competing outcomes associated with suicidal risk. Thirtyseven percent of trans men and women experienced at least one physical attack since the age of 13. On average, individuals experienced 3.97 (SD = 2.86) physical attacks; among these about half were attributed to one's gender identity or expression (mean = 2.08, SD = 1.96). In the multivariate multinomial regression, compared to those with no risk, being physically attacked increased the odds of both attempting and contemplating suicide regardless of gender attribution. Nevertheless, the relative impact of physical victimization on suicidal behavior was higher among those who were targeted on the basis of their gender identity or expression. Finally, no significant association was found between multiple measures of institutional discrimination and suicide risk once discriminatory and non-discriminatory physical victimization was taken into account. Trans men and women experience high levels of physical abuse and face multiple forms of discrimination. They are also at an increased risk for suicidal tendencies. Interventions that help transindividuals cope with discrimination and physical victimization simultaneously may be more effective in saving lives.","tags":null,"title":"Physical Victimization, Gender Identity and Suicide Risk among Transgender Men and Women","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gia Elise Barboza","Silvia Dominguez"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"a5d8f142423b72426f3bb887ed1cf44c","permalink":"https://giabarboza\u003e.github.io/publication/2016-01-01_using_behavioral_r/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016-01-01_using_behavioral_r/","section":"publication","summary":"The Human Papilloma Virus (``HPV'') is a common sexually transmitted disease that has infected approximately 79 million men and women in the United States alone.

The present study investigated the prevalence and risk factors of staff physical abuse among elderly individuals receiving nursing home care in Michigan. A random sample of 452 adults with elderly relatives, older than 65 years, and in nursing home care completed a telephone survey regarding elder abuse and neglect experienced by this elder family member in the care setting. Some 24.3% of respondents reported at least one incident of physical abuse by nursing home staff. A logistic regression model was used to estimate the importance of various risk factors in nursing home abuse. Limitations in activities of daily living (ADLs), older adult behavioral difficulties, and previous victimization by nonstaff perpetrators were associated with a greater likelihood of physical abuse. Interventions that address these risk factors may be effective in reducing older adult physical abuse in nursing homes. Attention to the contextual or ecological character of nursing home abuse is essential, particularly in light of the findings of this study.","tags":null,"title":"Physical Abuse of Older Adults in Nursing Homes: A Random Sample Survey of Adults With an Elderly Family Member in a Nursing Home","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lawrence B.

Stress, in the context of caregiving relationships, is a risk factor associated with increased prevalence of elder abuse in familial and institutional settings. As increasing numbers of older adults are moved from family caregiving to nursing home care settings, it becomes important to identify the pattern of elder abuse risk factors in nursing home facilities. An ecological model is proposed for better understanding the risk factors associated with elder abuse in nursing homes and the complex interaction of individual/person characteristics and contextual factors in institutional elder abuse. An ecological perspective to institutional elder abuse provides a framework for guiding and informing future research on the risk factors of nursing home abuse and, in turn, for the development of effective interventions and relevant social policies.","tags":null,"title":"Elder Abuse in Nursing Homes: An Ecological Perspective","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhenmei Zhang","Lawrence B.
