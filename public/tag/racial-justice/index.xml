      <title>Discrimination in the Targeting of Predatory Lending and Concomitant Foreclosures as Predictor of Historic Levels of Wealth Loss</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Predatory lending and foreclosures exacerbated the racial gap in homeownership and led to historic
wealth loss; past research lacked the key predatory characteristic and thus underestimates harm. With
advances in data science, availability of big data, and appropriate statistical and geo-spatial models, the
project will quantify the unequal wealth loss from predatory lending and estimate causal impact. The
dataset integrates HMDA, assessor, census, and HUD data, ZTRAX property and voting records. We
address: (1) the evolution of predatory lending mortgage originations over time and across geographic
areas; (2) If loans originations had kept their pre-housing bubble and foreclosure crisis trend, what would
wealth distribution be in areas hardest hit? The causal inference uses Bayesian structural time series
modeling to predict the counterfactual wealth gap had predatory lending not occurred. An Emergent Hot
Spot Analysis will identify hot and cold spots to predict spatiotemporal trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background-and-research-question&#34;&gt;Background and Research Question&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the early 2000s the United States (US) saw the highest percentages of homeownership in
history (Kochhar, Fry, and Taylor 2011). But by 2017, the percentage of property owned by Black and
Indigenous People of Color (BIPOC) in the US was less than it was 100 years earlier (Agyeman and
Boone 2020) and any early 2000s homeownership gains made by BIPOC had been reversed. This wealth
reduction was concurrent with the largest real estate bubble in US history, characterized by inflationary
price increases on homes that incentivized rapid-fire origination of “high cost” mortgages that were
overpriced relative to the value of the home (Goldstein 2014). But what was the role of predatory lending
and the longest and by far the worst foreclosure crisis since before the American Revolution in increasing
economic inequality today?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The housing bubble, starting in 2002, followed by the 2008 market crash and then the foreclosure
crisis of 2010, resulted in significant economic loss to individuals and neighborhoods. According to
Kochhar, Fry, and Taylor (2011), between 2005 and 2009, the median household wealth for Black, Latino
and Asian households in the United States dropped by 53%, 66% and 34%, respectively, while the
median wealth of white households dropped by merely 16%. As the study explained: “developments in
the housing market are the principal agents of change in household wealth from 2005 to 2009” (Kochhar,
Fry , and Taylor 2011 p.17) that are largely attributable to predatory lending originations and
disproportionately impacted working class communities of color, BIPOC and women heads of household
borrowers. Evidence suggests these practices continue to exert a negative effect on these communities
today. For example, a 2019 study conducted by the Urban Institute found that the 30% gap between black
and white home ownership is greater now than before 1968, when housing discrimination was legal
(Young 2019).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that the home ownership gap and, therefore, wealth divide, between white
households and households of color has been exacerbated by predatory lending through ongoing wealth stripping of inflated monthly billing as well as high foreclosure rates. For example, among home purchase loans made in 2006, roughly one out of every two loans made to African American (50%) and Latino
(46%) borrowers were high cost, compared to fewer than one out of five loans made to white borrowers
(18%) (Ben, Ellen, and Madar 2019). According to Squires (2005), the systematic channeling of
otherwise qualified minority borrowers into subprime mortgages carrying high costs and risks was one
form of reverse redlining. At the 2006 peak of the subprime market, 27% of all loan originations were
subprime, including 49% and 39% of loans to African-Americans and Latinos, respectively (Bocian, Li,
Reid, and Quercia 2011).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overinflated loan-to-value ratios are the single most important factor leading to default and/or
foreclosure (Quercia and Stegman 1992). Research has shown that even when loan to value ratios are raised from 90% to 97%, default rates for new homes increase seven-fold. Whereas the foreclosure crisis
coincided with sharp decreases in household wealth, with and without home equity, for all families,
regardless of race or ethnicity, research has shown that by 2011 wealth levels for whites began to show
signs of recovery. The typical Black family, on the other hand, continued to experience severe declines,
losing an estimated 40% of non-home-equity wealth throughout this time frame (Burd-Sharps &amp;amp; Rasch,
2015). The amount of wealth lost was and still is directly attributable to the magnitude and timing of the
housing bubble in different communities: that is, predatory lending began earlier, lasted longer, and was
more aggressive resulting in proportionately greater loss of wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, what would the wealth gap be had the type of lending, bubble and foreclosures never
happened? Several studies have attempted to quantify wealth gap differentials across individuals and
neighborhoods following the foreclosure crisis. Although these studies provide a general understanding of
how predatory lending practices have targeted low-income persons of color living in distressed
neighborhoods, they suffer from several methodological and data limitations. First, operational definitions
of “predatory lending” have not been clearly delineated and distinguished from “subprime lending” as
the latter can be legal and is not by law prohibited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, operational definitions have conflated
predatory loans with practices of lenders, even though an entity deemed a “subprime lender” may
originate both prime and subprime loans (Ho &amp;amp; Pennington-Cross, 2007). Second, different studies have
weighted loan characteristics differently and, while finding measurable discrimination and negative
financial consequences, previous studies have not analyzed the loan-to value-ratio , which other studies
have identified as the most important factor predicting default. The most important limitation of previous
research, however, pertains to the lack of applied methods to model the causal effect of the housing crisis
on wealth destruction, which requires a statistical framework that predicts the course of the foreclosure
crisis, and consequently wealth diminution, by examining what would have occurred had the historical
levels of predatory lending origination practices never occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
